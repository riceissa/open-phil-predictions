## Background

http://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants/internal-forecasts

## "known on" dates

- For predictions with no date of determination, we use a "known on" date 10
  years from the first day of the month following the grant month.
- For predictions with a date of determination, we use a "known on" date 2
  years after the date of determination, and include the date of determination
  in the prediction text. This is regardless of whether the date of
  determination has already passed.
