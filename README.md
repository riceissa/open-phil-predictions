In particular, see https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts#comment-320
in light of the comment above it, that explains Open Phil's plan around public updates on their internal forecasts.

## "known on" dates

- For predictions with no date of determination, we use a "known on" date 10
  years from the first day of the month following the grant month.
- For predictions with a date of determination, we use a "known on" date 2
  years after the date of determination, and include the date of determination
  in the prediction text. This is regardless of whether the date of
  determination has already passed.
