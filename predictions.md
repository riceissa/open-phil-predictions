>
> -   An 85% chance that Professor Gaunt will complete 80% of the work by
>     the end of the grant period.
> -   An 80% chance that we will consider this grant a success given that
>     Professor Gaunt completes at least 80% of the work.
> -   A 20% chance that Professor Gaunt follows up or causes someone else
>     to follow up with a proposal to widely effect positive policy change
>     in this area in the next ten years.
